      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a current student at DeVry Institute of Technology pursuing a role as a Cyber Security Analyst. I have experience and knowledge of monitoring networks for security intrusions, investigating security breaches and other incidents, installing countermeasures against viruses, malware, spyware, ability to assist in patching/updating operating systems, ability to protect system infrastructure, configure firewalls, and much more including understanding concepts of cloud (AWS, Azure, etc.) to ensure a company is protected, secure, and impenetrable. The best way to prepare for a cyber attack is to always know that the possibility of one exists!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. My mother is Ecuadorian and my father is Indian making me a mix of both!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy learning about new advancements in technology, participating in physical activities, and playing video games!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to one day become the CISO for an organization!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the beautifully stunning city of Chicago!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to work in cybersecurity</h1>
      <p>I've always had a strong passion for cybersecurity. I've always heard of terms being tossed around such as ethical hacking, red team, blue team, and it felt as if this career path would be the most enjoyable, fun, challenging, and overall the coolest!</p>
